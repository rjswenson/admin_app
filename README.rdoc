##### Admin Console (User Modifier) #####

--## Welcome! ##--

This project includes: Rails / Gems (Bootstrap) / HEROKU!!

http://boiling-falls-6936.herokuapp.com/

Spec:

   Generate a Rails app that allows a user to create, edit, update, and destroy (delete) users. Users should have first name, last name, and 
   email address fields. Deploy this app to Heroku 
   (a free *.herokuapp.com URL) so we can test it out live. 
   If you have time, add extra features to this app (be creative) and 
   tell us what you did so we donâ€™t miss it. 

Functionality:

   +User controller with routes for create/edit/update/destroy

   +db functionality with new user creation (first, last, email)
   +partial file '_error_messages' which lists errors if form is not filled out
   +User class contains validations

   +Form editibility with pre-filled forms and easy changing

   +moderately dynamic title (changes to Create, Manifest, Edit User)

   +secure_token.rb 'initializer' modified to appropriately protect site
   +private method in controller '#user_params' which restricts users from
    brute-force rewriting user hash with admin rights (if I had admin functionality)

   +Heroku hosting
